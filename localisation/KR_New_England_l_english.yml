### Parties ###
NEE_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
NEE_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - Essentially an extension of the CSA, the Totalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle. The Totalist faction of the SPA is notable for having heavier utopian 'Communist' and Bolshevik influence than other Totalists and often reject National Totalism. Nonetheless like the rest of New England SPA they are thought to be too weak to hold power on their own and would surely simply desire to see the CSA annex the territory."

NEE_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America  -  Essentially an extension of the CSA, the syndicalist members of the New England SPA want for workers to unite with the Combined Syndicates of America or, it fails, take up its mantle.

NEE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Liberal Republican Party - When the Intervention occurred, the Republican Party in New England was nearly destroyed. Now, as party officials attempt to put the pieces back together, there are increasing tensions over the party platform. Those more socially liberal-minded members of the party have split from the main party and are now calling themselves the Republican Party, though others have come to term them the "Liberal Republican Party". William Averall Harriman is the party standardbearer for the time being, but others have emerged in hopes of challenging him in the long term. Herbert H. Lehman, John Gilbert Winant, and powerful politician Thomas Dewey all hope to gain a spot at the head of the party, but time will tell to see which of these men will earn it. In the meantime, the party's espousal of education, a program of Social Security, and anti-corruption has made them popular with New Englanders, but with a split party, they may encounter difficulties in winning an election outright."
NEE_social_liberal_party:0 "Liberal Republican Party"
NEE_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
NEE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The battered Republican Party has started to re-form, but it is not the same party that existed before. Now, more laissez-faire minded liberals in the party argue with those who are more in favor of government intervention and social policy. The divide has caused a split in the party, and now the laissez-faire wing, represented first and foremost by Percival P. Baxter, finds itself alone. Baxter leads the party for now, but in the upcoming elections, he will face challenges from Hamilton Fish III, Joseph William Martin Jr., and Christian Herter, all fairly unknown politicians. Any of the three could rise in prominence in coming years however, and the path the party takes may depend on who leads it, and what happens to the other faction of the Republican Party. For now, the Republicans must face a united Democratic Party in the coming races, and will struggle to maintain power in many parts of New England."
NEE_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
NEE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party of New England is both renowned and infamous for it's extreme reliance on political machines (even by the standards of the rest of the nation), mainly the ones in Massachusetts and urban regions. With a strong working class, Catholic and immigrant voter base they semi-openly promote using the patronage system for the public good and often argue it allows a way for the common man to have more direct ties with political leaders through their local machines. Recently they have taken the most moderate stance towards foreign policy with regards to other parties, seemingly wanting to unite America if the opportunity arises but otherwise wanting to stay out of the war, and only maintaining relations with the Entente if it's useful. However given their non-ideological nature all are aware this could change in the future."

NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party2:0 "The Federalist Party"
NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party2_long:0 "The Federalist Party - The Federalist Party did not begin as such, being made up of those in the parties (and business) who favored closer ties with Canada and looking upon them for protection. Lead largely by American 'aristocrats' of Anglo-Saxon descent such as the Vanderbilt and Astor families, the 'The Committee to Defend America and the Crown' gradually merged with pro-Canadian business interests in the region until it became the leading pro-Entente group in the nation. Eventually as New England became besieged by syndicalism and the Radical Coalition, heavier political influence was needed and the alliance took the name of the old Federalist Party, a far older New England based party that was likewise pro-British. Viewing Canada as their best hope of beating back syndicalism and enriching New England, the Federalist Party half-expects to be appointed as the leaders of New England by Canada as a reward for their loyalism."

NEE_social_democrat_party_NP:0 "National Party"
NEE_social_democrat_party_long_NP:0 "National Party - The newly-formed National Party is made up of disgruntled Republican and Democratic voters, as well as some independents, who typically agree with the party's progressive platform. The National Party has made various appeals to both farmers and industrial workers, hoping to implement a form of crop insurance and to break monopolies. Eventually, one of the party's goals is to have full employment, so as to combat the Great Depression. The party's rising stars include George Aiken and Frances Perkins, and these figures hope to guide New England through this troubled time."

NEE_sentinel_national_populist_party:0 "The Sentinels of the Republic"
NEE_sentinel_national_populist_party_long:0 "Radical Coalition (The Sentinels of the Republic) - The more extreme wing of the Radical Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic began as a lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy in opposition to socialism before going through a series of internal radicalizations in the face of increasingly popular redistribution movements and attacks on the upper-class, influenced by the Remnant and New England's right-wing before adopting Alfred Sloan's arguments for the efficiency of unrestrained capitalism. In recent years the powerful DuPont family has taken charge of the organization, allowing greater Social Darwinist influences and using 'Tuckerist' arguments against not only socialists but even Remnant positions and the state itself which they view as too constraining, something old-school Tuckerists have decidedly mixed feelings about when seeing their positions merged with other Sentinel ones."

This overwhelmingly falls on the wealthy and allows for unproductive economic forces such as land speculation to be taxed while not taxing productive activities such as improvements to land or work income.

Born of the U.S. government’s 1928 raid on a degenerate coastal town in Massachusetts, the covert agency known as Delta Green opposes the forces of darkness with honor, but without glory. Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day — but often at a shattering personal cost. What needs to get done?

Bury’d now are the hatreds of subject and King, And the strife that once sunder’d an Empire hath vanish’d. With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish’d; And the broad British sea, Of her enemies free, Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee: For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side, Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!"

NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an air force and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home.

NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England.

NEE_International_Recognition_desc:0 "Some may see our government as illegitimate, elites more concerned with profits than the welfare of our people and existing only because we have been propped up by the Canadians.

NEE_back_french:0 "Back the French"
NEE_back_french_desc:0 "While we are close to our neighbors in Canada, let us not forget the others members of the Entente.

NEE_join_isac:0 "Join ISAC"
NEE_join_isac_desc:0 "The Imperial Scientific and Academic Council is the foremost organization for research in the Entente, if not the world.

NEE_new_english_fleet:0 "New English Fleet"
NEE_new_english_fleet_desc:0 "For three hundred years, New England has specialized in lumber and shipbuilding. Let us continue this tradition with a new navy.

NEE_armed_beacon_desc:0 "There are two ways we wish to portray our country. For one thing, we are a nation of immigrants and freedom, a beacon of liberty.

NEE_retake_long_island:0 "Retake Long Island"
NEE_retake_long_island_desc:0 "New York should be a part of New England. While we do control upstate New York, Long Island has evaded our control.

It is land that is rightfully ours. We will do what we can to secure it."

NEE_irish_relations:0 "Irish Relations"
NEE_irish_relations_desc:0 "Many of our people can trace their roots to Ireland. It is as much a part of our identity as Britain is.

NEE_court_catholics:0 "Court Catholics"
NEE_court_catholics_desc:0 "Catholics make up a sizeable chunk of the New England voting population and have a strong presence in our party.

NEE_powers_of_the_governor_desc:0 "The problem with the old American constitution is that it bestowed too much power on a bickering Congress and not enough on the executive powers that actually allocate resources.

No longer shall we finance public schooling."

NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "The state military system is a failure, being notable disloyal by accepting any government that takes power, a threat to liberty and soaking up absurd amounts of resources. Instead private defense contractors should take their place. While this will shrink the military it still leave the most qualified for fighting, and after corresponding tax cuts the Sentinel Organization will keep in the employ as many military men as it can afford, choosing quality over quantity. Those who desire protection can either pay us or go to another."

NEE_beyond_privatization_desc:0 "We are not merely going to put an end to tariffs and public utilities as the Freemen propose. No, we will go a step further than that.

NEE_right_of_contract:0 "Right of Contract"
NEE_right_of_contract_desc:0 "While the right to take by force is always on the table, it can be quite costly compared to signing a contract. The Right of Contract is an informal right that allows both ourselves and the people of the New England to settle their differences via signed agreement.

Many falsely equate our movement to revive the Anglo spirit of America to the religious fundamentalist or occult mystics that have taken root in the darkest corners of our nation.

Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day — but often at a shattering personal cost. What needs to get done? For a start, books need to be burned, artifacts smashed into powder, and men need to be silenced. Most of all, the future must never be allowed to become the present."

The current religious and mystical order in the Americas reveals not life lessons and guidance but miserable platitudes that ultimately leaves the soul unsatisfied. The Judeo-Christian God as we know it offers us no answers. Providence, anointed by the one true God, has seen the dark universe yawning. Where the black planets roll without aim. Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge lustre, or name. By studying his mythos and anthropomorphizing his characters into a form of occult study, we can perhaps clean a small sliver of his endless dark wisdom."

Even though Providence knows that he crafts works of fiction, and that these cults are comprised of insane lunatics; he cannot deny their devotion to him.

However, as of now Lovecraft is not but a puppet for the Anglophiles that run our nation. The Loyal Coalition was born out of fear and hatred of the unknown, and indeed resonated with Lovecraft and New England’s WASP majority. However, it is time to do away with them.

Adna "Father" Chaffee, General John J. Pershing, Ernest "Old Gravel Voice" Harmon, and politician Theodore F. Green are in the running, and the decision has come: who to appoint?"
NEE_appoint_chaffee:0 "Father Chaffee"
NEE_appoint_chaffee_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee has been an avid horseman his whole life. Now, however, he urges us to embrace the future. Chaffee is specifically concerned with tanks. He argues that a tank force will allow New England to glide across the vast North American terrain and the smaller battlefields of Western Europe alike. Father Chaffee will lead us to victory."
NEE_mechanical_cavalry:0 "Mechanical Cavalry"
NEE_mechanical_cavalry_desc:0 "Real wars are fought by real men, not solely by tanks. However, we can still use technology to serve these men. As horses served armies in the past, let us send trucks and motorized vehicles alongside our troops. This will make them faster and better supplied. We will strike the enemy with lightning speed."
NEE_coordination_principal:0 "The Coordination Principle"
NEE_coordination_principal_desc:0 "As the foremost power in the world, Germany's military should be something to emulate. Some German officials believe that airplanes should work together with infantry and tanks, in order to strike the enemy before they even understand what is coming. Let us emulate this tactic. This will greatly aid our inter-branch cooperation and experience."
NEE_experimental_organization:0 "Experimental Divisions"
NEE_experimental_organization_desc:0 "Father Chaffee has relentlessly pressed us to not only modernize our vehicles, but to experiment with new ones.

NEE_infantry_investments:0 "Infantry Research Developments"
NEE_infantry_investments_desc:0 "Some of our officials want us to focus on tanks or artillery. Pershing disagrees. He is quick to point out that in his day, infantry were the driving force behind armies, and he believes they still are.

NEE_breakthrough_emphasis:0 "Breakthrough Emphasis"
NEE_breakthrough_emphasis_desc:0 "As a man who has been a senior officer in the military long enough to see the Weltkrieg come and go, General Pershing believes breakthroughs are a crucial part of warfare.

NEE_merit_promotion:0 "Promotion by Merit"
NEE_merit_promotion_desc:0 "An effective military should always issue promotions based on merit, not bloodline.

NEE_black_combat_troops:0 "Black Combat Training"
NEE_black_combat_troops_desc:0 "Pershing is in favor of a "separate-but-equal" approach to Black soldiers. He has encouraged the creation of all-black units and insists that their training is indeed equal to that of any other soldier.

NEE_artillery_line_desc:0 "Harmon argues that an investment in artillery would go a long way in breaking through to the south, or in any other theater of war. With artillery coming first, the enemy line will be like melted butter, and our infantry will be the knife that slices through it."

Let us train our men and build our equipment to serve this purpose."
NEE_mechanical_drawing:0 "Westpoint Engineering"
NEE_mechanical_drawing_desc:0 "Westpoint is one of the greatest military institutions in the world, but officers are not the only graduates.

NEE_bombing_support:0 "Bombing Support"
NEE_bombing_support_desc:0 "We shall bomb our enemy into submission until they praise the lord.

NEE_firepower_purchase:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
NEE_firepower_purchase_desc:0 "We will purchase tanks, artillery, motorized vehicles, and other equipment such as bullets to make sure our men are never out of ammo.

NEE_consistant_conscription:0 "Consistent Conscription"
NEE_consistant_conscription_desc:0 "Green's bill has passed, and we are now conscripting our young men to build a larger army than ever before. None of our rivals will outnumber us.

NEE_yankee_nationalism_desc:0 "We are Yankees, and we are proud of it. Reactionaries to the south use this term in a derogatory meaning, but to New Englanders, it is part of our identity. Though we now fight with our old rulers, we will never forget we became in the meantime."
NEE_farmer_soldiers:0 "Farmers into Soldiers"
NEE_farmer_soldiers_desc:0 "Farmers should not be exempt from the draft. They are some of our strongest citizens, and could serve us well in the military.

NEE_silver_military_lease:0 "Silver Lease"
NEE_silver_military_lease_desc:0 "Let us release silver that the government owns, in order to help serve our war effort.

The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored. While some in the [Root.GetAdjective] cabinet feel the Canadians have violated our sovereignty, there is little we can do about it at the moment."

newengland.2.a:0 "To War"
newengland.2.b:0 "We will Deal with this later!"

newengland.3.t:0 "Terror in New England"
newengland.3.d:0 "New England has been besieged by syndicalist militia violence, and the governors in the region are terrified that the Federal government won't be able to prevent a rapid takeover of the entire region. Apparently they went so far as to formally request an intervention by [CAN.GetNameDef], but the Canadian government has declined to get involved... at least as of yet. As a result, militia groups in Boston are rapidly mobilizing to try and organize a proper defence of the area."
newengland.3.a:0 "We'll help as much as we're able"

newengland.5.t:0 "The Question of New England"
newengland.5.d:0 "Now that we have intervened in New England, a number of Canadian ministers have met with leaders from those states regarding how best to keep order. The states have suggested setting up a provisional government for the region, one that would - at least initially - be under our control and brought into the Entente alliance. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we simply occupied and adminstered the territory ourselves. Americans, they say, can sometimes be of suspect loyalty - grateful or not, their goals may not mirror our own."
newengland.5.a:0 "Set up the provisional government"
newengland.5.b:0 "Set up the provisional government (play as New England)"

newengland.6.t:0 "The Provisional government of New England"
newengland.6.d:0 "Thanks to our allies in Canada, we have set up a provisional government in Boston as we prepare to liberate the rest of our country. Unfortunately, not many people both in and out of the states in New England believe that we are the true and legitimate America, and we must rectify this problem"
newengland.6.a:0 "Don't tread on me!"

newengland.7.t:0 "America is Reunited"

## Focus Tree Events ###

newengland.10.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.10.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the workers within America. This bill is facing some push-back from the more conservative members of Congress that believe that we are trying to implement syndicalism. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.10.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.10.b:0 "Do Not Pass the Act."

newengland.11.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.11.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the economy and workplace. The so-called Labor-Relations Act is obviously designed to help the businesses over the workers. And thus, it is facing push-back from the more liberal members of Congress that believe it does not go far enough. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.11.a:0 "Pass the Act."
newengland.11.b:0 "Do not Pass the Act."

newengland.12.t:0 "New England Demands Home Rule"
newengland.12.d:0 "The New England provisional government, now that it has established its military and structure, has demanded that it be granted home rule. Some members of the Canadian government are taken aback by the tone of the demand, seeing as the Canadian government is what enabled New Englanders to avoid the chaos rampant in the rest of America, though others (perhaps rightly) point out that unless Canada's ambition is to govern Americans as colonial subjects there is no reason not to give New England what it seeks."
newengland.12.a:0 "Grant them home rule."
newengland.12.b:0 "No, they are too valuable."

newengland.13.t:0 "Canada Agrees"
newengland.13.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to our demand in the affirmative. They are ready to relinquish all control over our government apparatus, and have expressed williness to work with us as equal partners in the Entente alliance."
newengland.13.a:0 "We are grateful."

newengland.14.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
newengland.14.d:0 "Perhaps deciding that we are too valuable an asset in their quest to retake the Home Isles, or perhaps secretly coveting New England's territory as their own, the Canadian government has refused to grant New England home rule. We are, at least for the foreseeable future, their subject...something which has provided a serious blow to our government's legitimacy."
newengland.14.a:0 "This is an outrage!"

newengland.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declares Independence"

newengland.15.b:0 "No, this cannot be allowed!"

newengland.124.t:0 "New England's Foreign Policy?"
newengland.124.d:0 "Our young nation must now create a foreign policy for itself. Two main schools of thought have presented themselves. One says we move closer to our allies in the North, and help the Entente. The other promotes a more neutral approach to foreign policy that will see us govern ourselves."`
newengland.124.a:0 "Cooperate with the Entente"
newengland.124.b:0 "Go our own way"

newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"


newengland.42.t:0 "Royal visit to New England"
newengland.42.d:0 "King-Emperor Edward the 8th and his wife Isabelle of Orleans have arrived in Boston today to mark improved ties between New England and Canada. This is the first time that a reigning British monarch has visited Boston in its entire history. As to be expected large jubilant crowds of New Englanders have come out to catch a sight of the King and Queen of the British Empire. The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."
newengland.42.a:0 "Welcome to Boston!"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organizations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organizations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."

President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."

Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy.

When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx.

newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."

With the IWW and Socialist Parties still causing problems it is clear we are not out of the woods yet, and governor [NEE.GetLeader] has declared that anyone who attempts to overthrow the government and establish a 'syndicalist tyranny' will face the full force of the law."

newengland.102.t:0 "Radical Coalition formalizes!"
newengland.102.d:0 "The so-called Radical Coalition has cemented its political alliance in reaction to both Canadian and syndicalist influence in New England. This occurred after members of the two leading factions of the movement, "The Remnant" and "The Sentinels of the Republic", met and agreed to pool together their formally fairly weak militias. A loose grouping within New England lead by right-wing intellectuals and organizations, the Coalition is unified in viewing the State as the ultimate threat to man and the syndicalists as merely another group of fanatics attempting to use it for their own agenda of abolishing property laws. With the increase in populist movements in recent years, more middle and upper class citizens have listened to this faction of New England politics as both a counter-revolutionary force and a solution to the problem of politics. Albert Jay Nock is leader of the Remnant and the Freemen magazine, and the more radical wing of the Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic, started as a right-wing lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy before going through a series of internal radicalizations. This involved influence from the Remnant and New England Right before turning to a mixture of Social Darwinist sciences and reinterpretations of Egoism to use their arguments against not only wealth redistribution but any attacks on the wealthy. This is something the original Egoists, whose arguments they borrowed, have mixed or even negative feelings about. \n\n With the formalization of the alliance, their supporters in Congress have officially changed their party affiliation to the Radical Coalition, with the Sentinels providing the funding and the Remnant the militia volunteers. Together they declare man's freedoms will not end so long as they are on watch."

We must either send our own men to try to overtake the militias which will be bloody but likely end in a victory, request Canadian assistance at the cost of likely becoming more reliant on Canada, something that is sure to anger many New Englanders but might end in a more favorable resolution.

With the Vanderbilt and Astor families already competing for power within the Federalist machine to prepare for Canadian appointments, Radicals are already furious at the idea of English royalists seizing the nation and have stated their intent to declare a revolution, but do not have quite enough resources to do so. Perhaps it would be better to endorse the Radical cause and provide it with our remaining military and political aid to pressure Canada to leave, effectively allowing us to play both sides, although many would see this as a dangerous ploy when Canada offers us security."

However the situation is still unstable and they have yet to even unify behind a candidate for President, of which the well-connected and pro-Federalist Astor and Vanderbilt families seemingly spending every dime and bit of political capital competing for top spot. The Astor's closer ties to Canada's political elite give them greater comfort to the Canadian elite and more direct political ties whereas the Vanderbilt's are favored by more of New England for their wealth being based out of the region and heavier philanthropy, with their new money extravagances often being the talk of the town (for better or worse). /n/The candidates include the more traditionally aristocrat and English officer John Jacob Astor whose birth in America would technically make him qualified to run for President but nonetheless makes him more unpopular to locals, the philanthropist Vincent Astor who is more popular within New England (by Astor standards) but less connected to us and too personally reformist for the tastes of many Canadian conservatives, prominent yachtsman and card player Harold Stirling Vanderbilt who seems acceptable to the New England populace despite being less so to Canadian royals and finally motor car racer William Kissam Vanderbilt, whom is quite popular in the area but only somewhat interesting in governing if not for his family allowing him to use him as a candidate."

Nonetheless the most controversial parts of the new Constitution, including a provision that would see the both the President and Senators elected for life by electors is sure to endanger only more hatred until it can pass, as would its weakening of the states for Federal power.

Of course, hardline Egoists and 'Radical Anarchists' in the party are unlikely to go with it, but with the wealthy upper core of the Sentinels on our side we would have their wealth resources at our disposal.

newengland.118.d:0 "With their forces spread throughout New England and continued rallying of citizens to their cause to maintain sovereignty, the Radicals have demanded control of Congress, removing politicians who were found to be too friendly to the Federalist, Canadian or Socialist cause and replacing them with their own, and the Congress moved to continue to support this on a state level. As such, the Radicals have control of our Congress to the enthusiasm of popular writers such as H.L. Mencken and horror to Canadian allies. It appears their American revolutionary uniforms have become less goofy than we once we dismissed them as."

The Sentinels are far more radical, favoring the solution of the state in favor of a "Natural Capitalism", and are led by the DuPoint family, whom are being accused of literally buying delegates with Sentinel funds. In between them are the more traditional anarcho-egoists who are split between a Sentinel force they view as corrupting their message but nonetheless are more serious about dissolving the state and supporting the Remnant. It is likely they will decide the dominant faction."

newengland.201.t:0 "The Second Hartford Convention"
newengland.201.d:0 "With New England under Canadian protection, the first order of business remains the establishment of a legitimate government in this time of crisis, and the reaffirmation and recognition of the Constitution of the United States as the primary source of law and authority in the nation. Leaders and statesmen are making their way to Connecticut, hoping to make history with their involvement in the preservation of America. Others, however, see the Convention as more than an opportunity to not reaffirm the Constitution, but a place to make crucial changes to the document to prevent yet another Civil War. These political dissidents have flocked to the immigrant-backed and Quaker-led alliance under Clarence Pickett or Lovecraft’s increasingly militant and outspoken Loyal Coalition. Canadian liberation has given us freedom and isolation from the Second American Civil War. Yet, with the Second Hartford Convention about to begin, the future of New England seems even more uncertain."
newengland.201.a:0 "New England sleeps..."

newengland.202.t:0 "Lovecraft and the Providence Circle"
newengland.202.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders.\n\nInitially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists. "

newengland.203.d:0 "As America spiralled into war, many turned to Alcohol to escape their troubles. The War, the destruction and all the world can be forgotten about by simply taking a sip of various fermented plants. That is the plan. However, in reality people abuse the Devil’s nectar, and use it to commit horrible acts in their drunken rage. As well the productivity of all people decrease as the worker partakes in suds instead of doing their job. So, as Drunkenness ravages New England and the rest of the United States an unexpected force has risen from the dead. Due to the nationwide failure of prohibition, most sane people assumed that the Prohibition Party was dead in the ground; however, is has made a stunning comeback as New England is ravaged by drunkenness. The party now mainly bases itself in New England and is lead by David Leigh Colvin. Colvin believes that all New Englanders must be moral, compassionate, and caring for every man. The party’s main platform is to illegalize the sale and production of Alcohol, as well as prohibiting Pornography, instilling Christian Values into the nation, and helping the American Refugees fleeing from the Civil War. The party’s sudden re-birth has surprised many within New England, but can the party truly return from the dead?"

newengland.303.t:0 "The Quaker Alliance"
newengland.303.d:0 "Originally disregarded and laughed at by established politicians, Clarence Pickett’s Quaker Alliance has managed to gain a concerning amount of sway within New England. Pickett has brought the Religious Society of Friends (AKA ‘Quakers’) to the forefront of New English politics by offering unconditional support to immigrants and refugees alike, while working to change the church from a religious institution into an outspoken political party dedicated to international neutrality, pacifism, and Christian charity. Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent."

This, in turn, has resulted in greater competition for fewer jobs between Americans and Immigrants. And Black Monday has only made things worse! The Republicans see immigration as a threat to New England’s stability; introducing alien philosophies like Syndicalism and Catholicism. The Democrats, though normally a conservative party, have benefited from the Irish community as a voter base in the Northeast. The Prohibitionists and the Quakers, to the horror of everyone gathered, have suggested throwing open the doors of New England as a land of Christian charity and opportunity.

While professional soldiery will always present the best defense, some argue that New England needs bodies more than it needs professionals. The Republicans advocate an elite, limited army with Canadian backing, while the Democrats demand widespread conscription to protect against Syndicalism. Colvin’s Prohibitionists, in keeping with their Pacifist beliefs, have proposed a radical idea: complete disarmament and an open hand towards all.

newengland.215.d:0 "Despite claims to the contrary, the Supreme Court has long been a politicized body, and it is for this reason that American politicians have so frequently fought over justices and threatened to pack the court, like Bill Haywood. The debate breaking the Democratic-Republican Coalition is whether the new President should be allowed to appoint all new justices, or whether each state should provide a new justice. The Republicans prefer to draft judges from each state. The Democrats favor the old system, likely because they believe their dominance of Massachusetts will allow them to carry the election. The Quaker Alliance and the Prohibitions have proposed a radical new plan of dissolving the Supreme Court and instead relying a completely federalized system of high courts in each state."

Do we trust our leaders to use this newfound power to protect us or will we limit them to ensure men like Long, Reed, and Haywood cannot plunge us into anarchy again? It’s most pressing in New England, because many of the delegations are led by state Governors... who until now have had independent authority. If one of their number wins the election, will the rest surrender power to this First Among Equals? The Republicans advocate preserving federalism as New England is only a temporary creation until America is reborn. The Democrats argue New England’s government needs more power if it’s going to rebuild America. The Prohibitionists and the Quakers... question the very necessity of power. Trust is more important."

Clarence had his secretary send out invitations to all leaders of the major belligerent factions of the Second American Civil War for a good, old-fashioned, New England Thanksgiving.

The Irish in New England have also begun to take arms, as they believe that the radical Anglophiles will soon drive them out.  These tensions that have been simmering below the surface finally erupted today. When protests erupted in Boston today over the coronation of an Autocratic King. Most New-Englanders have declared Canada and the Windsor’s illegitimate. People have been in an uproar, and violence has been widespread. The largest of these protests have been in Boston, the nation's capital. As the Irish and the England take up arms against each other, Canada desperately tries to bring stability to New England, to no avail. And in the end, Canada may have to take sides in what is rapidly becoming a Civil War.

This comes as a shock not just to the people of New England, but the world. As Lovecraft’s isolation and paranoia has made it almost impossible for him to achieve any sort of political power. However, something has changed in Lovecraft. Perhaps he knows that he is near death, perhaps his overwhelming hatred of the Irish Catholics drove him. Whatever the case may be, Lovecraft and his allies in the Loyal Coalition march for Boston, the center of the Irish Scourge. There, Lovecraft, and his allies within the Providence Circle are expected to make an address, a prospect that terrifies the timid Lovecraft.

The “Men in Black” quickly dispersed the crowd while the X-Brigade secured the surrounding area. But the men soon realized that a coverup was not as easy as expected, and the saucer appeared to be 2-3 times larger than originally estimated.

Rather than the naïve platitudes of the old order, cosmicism states that there is no recognizable divine presence such as a god in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence. There is no higher purpose, nor grand notions of what we could conventionally call good or evil. There is only the infinite futility of existence, a fragile and delicate flash in the pan of a dark and uncaring universe barely registered by the cosmic gods that dwell beyond our perception and shape our reality through hypergeometry. To a student of cosmicism, these beings are not simply fantasy but a statistical inevitability given the infinite and terrifying scale of the universe."

Her skill in driving and repairing motor vehicles earned her a position in her brigade, and quickly rose through the ranks as her commanding officers died in the war. Her rapid rise through the military command structure may have been aided by her noble status, but her own hard work and skills gained her position.

During the first era of prohibition in the United States speakeasies became the norm; so, we have experience in dealing with these elicit centers of sin and drunkenness. However, as Bar Culture dies down so does the revenue they produce, as the Alcohol served in speakeasies is not being taxed in any way by the government.

However, we can deter people from these practices by rendering these alcohols un-drinkable. In response to this, our current government has required all makers of industrial alcohols to denaturatie their product. This process of denaturing the alcohol has put in their alcohol deadly ingredients. Toxic ingredients, such as kerosene ,brucine, gasoline, benzene, cadmium, iodine, zinc, mercury salts, nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, camphor, carbolic acid, quinine, acetone and other poisonous ingredients are being put into their product to render it in-consumable. The government hopes that poisoning the industrial alcohols will be the ultimate deterrent against alcoholism, and if we receive backlash from the people, we can simply cover our tracks and blame it on booze tainted with metals and other impurities.

Yet who can deny the thrilling implications, the scientific discovery, and the military applications if we were to further study and cooperate with these visitors from the stars? To that end, a group of twelve high ranking officials from all corners of the government have convened to create Majestic-12, a cabal dedicated to the purpose of investigating and recovering alien spacecraft.

Where each organization once worked behind the scenes to undermine the other, tensions have now broken out into open acts of violence against each other with agents on all sides quietly targeting their rivals and attempting to purge them from various institutions across the country.

newengland.257.d:0 "When Providence originally began the process of rewriting his novella “Shadow Over Innsmouth” into a more substantial tome, it was merely to satisfy the demand of his followers to expand on its themes and motifs to better immerse the reader in Lovecraft’s world building and philosophy following his break-out success. With his rise to prominence and political dominance however, The Shadow Over Innsmouth has undergone a beautiful and terrifying transformation not unlike that of the Deep Ones of the titular Innsmouth itself. Consisting of two parts, the first half of the book is written from the perspective of the narrator and essentially consists of various curated poems, letters, and speeches previously written by Providence. Several passages are addressed directly to the reader on the nature of New England heritage and narrator’s personal philosophy, who is clearly a stand-in for Providence himself. It is generally understood that this first section exists purely to equip the reader with essential knowledge and build their mental fortitude before the second half.\n\n The story then rapidly unravels into an epic tale and deep dive into the very heart of Lovecraft’s mythos. It is an autobiography, a fabricated story, a description of godhood, equal parts truth and lie, a how-to guide for apotheosis, a profane poem, a holy scripture, an apology for Lovecraft’s actions, a profane gesture to those who'd question his or New England’s legitimacy, and an explanation of how a meek and patient man could rise to such greatness. It is at once a terrifying look into the mind of Providence, a guide on how to become like Him, and an intensely disturbing and immersive story that would take a lifetime to process fully.\n\nWhile weaker minds have been driven to madness by Providence’s magnum opus, those capable of finishing his work without losing themselves emerge fundamentally changed.

Mackenzie King is a well-known believer in the spiritual and the unknown and has taken a particular liking to Lovecraft’s spiritualism and works. And in private, the conversation shifted from the political, to the paranormal and spiritual. Lovecraft and King talked at great lengths about spirits, ghosts and other paranormal occurrences. Rumor even had it that King and Lovecraft held a Seance to communicate with the spirit of the late King George V to ask him for guidance on reclaiming the home isles.

Like Lovecraft, their popularity cam from the hatred of outsiders, mostly Irish Catholics. But, instead of the Loyal Coalition being propped up by proud, pure WASPS, they were propped up by the Astors and Vanderbilts. Elites that will stop at nothing for a quick buck, and that included stepping on this Nation’s Loyal Citizens. \n\n They fully expected that Lovecraft would never take action against them, that he would remain timid and stay in place.

He would never challenge their power. \n\n That is what they thought, and they thought wrong. \n\n Despite Lovecraft’s Agoraphobia, Paranoia and fear; being in practical charge of a large State has changed him. He was no puppet, and the time to finally get rid of the Elites was here. The big Businessmen who have ruined New England for so long would do so no longer. \n\n The Purge began at 11:00, when Loyal Divisions of the Providence Guard fanned into the streets of Boston, dragging so called “Enemies of Purity” from their homes and offices, and some into Delta Green Black Sites. There, anything awaits them; and none of it can possibly be good. \n\n Even though some tried to resist, Lovecraft’s grip on the nation had become too strong. The Populace, the Military and the Bureaucracy were all loyal to him and him alone, something that the Elites weren’t counting on.\n\n By the end of the night, names were carefully crossed of lists as one by one, Lovecraft’s Enemies were Killed, Arrested or somehow, were condemned to a fate even worse."

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."

He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return.
